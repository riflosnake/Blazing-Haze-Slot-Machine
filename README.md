## View code:
- Open main folder above and see `slot.py` file. 

## Install:
- Go to `Releases` on the right, under `Assets` there should be `Blazing Haze.exe`. Click on it, install it and open it to start playing.

## How to play:

For a better user experience, it is recommended to use buttons on the keyboard rather than the buttons.

- `Space`: It is the main button, used to `spin`, `claim` pot or skip spinning animation.
- `Left Arrow Button`: Can `raise bet size` incrementally, or when won a combination, can trigger gamble mode.  When in gamble mode, picks the `red` color card.
- `Right Arrow Button`: `Maxes bet size` (10k), or when won a combination, can trigger gamble mode. When in gamble mode, picks the `black` color card.
- `Enter`: Press to `input cash`, or withdraw money and `close game`.

## Rarity and payouts:

Each tier going down, is approximately twice as rare as the previous one.
Payout coefficients are for 3, 4 and 5 in a row sequences. Stars do not need to be in a row.

- 🍒 and 🍋 => `1.6x`, `4x` and `16x`
- 🍊 and 🍌 => `2x`, `5x` and `20x`
- 🍉 and 🍇 => `4x`, `16x` and `40x`
- ⭐ => `0.8x`, `4x` and `20x`
- 7️⃣ =>  `8x`, `80x` and `400x`!

### Have fun spinning!
