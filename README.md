### To check the code, open main folder above and see slot.py file. To install the application, go to Releases on the right, under Assets there should be Blazing Haze.exe. Click on it, install it and open it to start playing.

## How to play:

For a better user experience, it is recommended to use buttons on the keyboard rather than the buttons.

- `Space`: It is the main button, used to `spin`, `claim` pot and skip spinning animation.
- `Left Arrow Button`: Can `raise bet size` incrementally, or when won a combination, can trigger gamble mode.  When in gamble mode, picks the `red` color card.
- `Right Arrow Button`: `Maxes bet size` (10k), or when won a combination, can trigger gamble mode. When in gamble mode, picks the `black` color card.
- `Enter`: Press to `input cash`, or withdraw money and `close game`.

### Have fun spinning!
